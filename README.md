# GraphIntelligence Core

GraphIntelligence Core is a full-stack intelligence system designed to visualize and analyze network relationships and entity risk levels in real-time.

## Key Features
* **Entity Management**: Register and manage nodes within the intelligence network.
* **Network Linking**: Establish and visualize relationships between different actors.
* **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time graph visualization using force-directed algorithms for deep network exploration.
* **Risk Analytics**: Automatic calculation of risk scores and detection of key influential players within the network.
* **Data Export**: Export intelligence reports and entity data to CSV format for external analysis.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: React.js & Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend**: Go (Golang) with Fiber framework.
* **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL).
* **Library**: React Force Graph for network visualization.

## My Role
As an **Informatics student at Telkom University**, I developed this project as a **Full-stack Developer**. I was responsible for:
* Designing and implementing the Go-based REST API.
* Building the interactive frontend and intelligence dashboard.
* Managing the database schema and real-time data integration with Supabase.
